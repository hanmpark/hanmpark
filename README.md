### Pinned Projects

I love to channel my learnings into practical applications. Here's a highlight of my projects:

	<a href="https://github.com/hanmpark/scholarship_logtime">
		<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=hanmpark&repo=scholarship_logtime&theme=transparent">
	</a>
</div>

> [!NOTE]
> This is an exlusively designed program for 42 Nice GEN scholarship students:
This program calculates cumulative logtime from the 27th of the previous month to the 26th of the current month or any specified month. It simplifies tracking and managing scholarship requirements, reflecting my commitment to creating solutions that address real-world needs.

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> The Mini Ray Tracer project is a compact yet powerful demonstration of ray tracing technology, designed as a hands-on exploration into the fundamentals of graphics programming. This project renders 3D scenes by simulating the way light rays intersect with objects and calculate colors based on materials and light sources. Ideal for those interested in computer graphics, this project showcases my ability to implement complex algorithms and understand the physics of light. Dive into the world of digital illumination and discover how simple principles can lead to stunning visuals.
